 ## Introduction
Following the end of WWI, President Warren G. Harding makes a speech about how America needs normalcy and peace, not more reolvution and change.
- Following WWI, the country felt disillusioned
	- More than 115,000 U.S. soldiers died in a year of fighting
	- labor strikes hit after the war
	- national unemployment hit 20%
	- radicals and anarchists cause chaos
	- farmers are going bankrupt

The 1920's are nothing but normal however.
	One one hand:
		Mass production of goods brings rise to consumerism
		New forms of entertainment such as radio, TV, movies, jazz
		"The new negro" and "The new woman" arise
	On the other hand:
		KKK is revived to be even more prominent
		New immigration policies are put in place

The rise of mass production leads to an excess of goods that can be sold
1. this leads to the rise of "modern" advertisement. people need to make new and exciting advertisements to sell all this extra product. creates a culture of consumption

The rise of mass entertainment (movies, radio, television, coney island) is attributed to the culture of escape at the time.
- People want to escape the horrors of world war one and a cold industrial lifestyle in urban areas
	- Rise of the automobile as an ultimate symbol as freedom
	- advertisements in this era largely focused on ideas of personal freedom and escape


## Republican White House, 1921-1933

Harding signs legislation to dismantle the wartime controls over industry

Fear of anything not 100% american creates fear and prejudice against immigrants

Labor movement loses support from public during the 1920's

Hardings presidency was very corrupt. However the people he appointed to the cabinet were well qualified
- Herbert hoover is made secretary of commerce
- Henry Wallace is made secretary of agriculture

However, trouble occurs when Harding appoints his friends and supporters to these positions
- These officials get caught trying to lease land to oil companies in exchange for cash. this harms Harding's presidency

Coolidge comes after Harding's death.
- Supported american buisness interests the most
- Did not support labor strikes/unions/consumers/laborers
	- Wanted to focus on "buisness"
	- reduced taxes on the wealthy 

Women begin to take a role in activism in the 1920's since they can now vote.
- Prohibition gets put into effect as the 18th amendment
- Women seek a lot of things to improve society
	- Federal aid for education
	- Reduce infant and child mortality
	- Remove discrimination by sex
		- ERA (Equal Rights Act) is introduced but doesnt make it past congress

Politics in the 1920's are dominated by the republicans
- "Buisness party"
- Within the republican party, there are two people running for president
1. Al Smith, governor of new york
	- Immigrant background makes nativists upset
	- Tammany hall + anti-prohibition politics offend reformers
2. Herbert Hoover
	- good reputation from his work in WWI
	- fully american, protestant

The 1928's election reflected the attitudes of the era because Herbert hoover got elected instead of Al Smith.
- Al Smith didnt resonate and was disliked by many different movements at this time
	- Nativists didnt like how he had an immigrant background
	- He was against prohibition so that put many people against him
		- Prohibition was a big thing that came out of the 1920's, symbol of womens movements and reform
	- His connections to tammany hall also make him disliked


Herbert hoover wins and he focuses on economic growth + prosperity
- Standardized lots of things so that companies can make more money

## Culture of consumption
New technologies in manufacturing and energy production leads to a dramatic rise in production output
- extremely high amounts of supply
	- People worry that supply will exceed demand and the economy will suffer, leading to development of new advertisement techniques to create a culture of consumption

The modern department store is created out of the culture of consumption
- Extremely diverse range of products
- Very elaborate store designs and advertisements
- New services like babysitting, resturants, and writing rooms
- Shopping becomes very fun and exciting because of these new department stores, leading to lots of success here

Americans are now using credit to buy things like cars.
- This makes it very easy to buy a car and other big things
- encourages people to buy even more things

Cars are huge in america now, 80% of the cars in the world are in america

## Culture of escape
People become overwhelmed by all the innovations and new technologies.
- Just like how all the innovation created a culture of consumption, it also created a feeling of being "trapped"

Urban areas are very industrial now, people dont really like this so they want to escape.
Cars and new forms of entertainment make this possible for everyone.
- People listen and watch lots of films and songs that portray things like freedom
- people drive off to do their own things and go on vacation

The new culture of escape and popularity of cars creates a market for things like gas stations, diners, hotels, and billboards

Film industry becomes big, rise of hollywood
- Hollywood was originally started by jewish immigrants and wasnt very popular. once they started to change their films to portray american values, the popularity exploded

Films bring people from all social classes together.
- Films were originally seen as dumb low class entertainment
	- Perspective changed to make films more popular
- Middle and upper class people are attracted by longer and higher quality films
- working class people are attracted by mixing traditional and modern values
- Film tickets are very affordable for lots of people
	- African Americans are segregated or excluded though

The "flapper" was a woman who wore short skirts, makeup, and smoked cigars
- was sort of like a rebellion against the gender norms of the time.
- women experienced much more freedom and opportunity, which let them express themselves like this

Radios are used to entertain lots of people at home
- radio shows are created
- advertisements can be brought into the home now

pop culture has spread across all of the u.s.

Jazz music was created in new orleans, but spread across all of america through radio
- represented african american cultural independence
- AA's felt like white people owned everything. jazz was something that they created and could claim as their own

Jazz was seen as "savage" and disliked by older generations because of its racial origins
- despite this, jazz was very popular because of how catchy it was
- The Jazz Singer was a movie that came out of this, making Al Jolson the most popular singer in America

Professional sports evolve out of the 1920's
- radio broadcasts of major sports events
	- still racially segregated though

After so much death and destruction because of world war 1, america craved heros like Babe Ruth, Dempsey, and Grange in sports.

- inspiring to americans because it shows that technology can be used to make great things.

Popular culture in the 1920's revolved around the idea of escape.
- Coney island had lots of crazy and novel things for americans to experience, made it very popular
- rise of automobiles as a symbol of freedom
- the rise of pop culture doesnt really get rid of the trauma from world war one, but it makes the future look better

## The new woman

Consumer culture was mainstream and encouraged materialism and individual pleasure.
- Reflected by the flapper

the flapper broke gender norms for women and rejected old values of modesty and self restraint.
-  these flappers take full advantage of the new opportunities at the time
	- men and women both participate in speakeasies and blind tigers
		- prohibition movement has this equalizing effect

the new woman worked outside of the home
- they now had time to exercise the right to vote

However, they still were a little limited
- many occupations are still male dominated and it is hard for women to have leadership
- the introduction of women into the workforce changed the impression of the jobs instead of changing the work culture
	- jobs become "womens work"

so many women were rebelling against previous gender norms that it basically was conformity to a new movement

## The new negro

## Fundamentalist Christianity

christian fundamentalism comes from anxiety over the loosening of social morals and new social freedom.

modernists claimed that not all parts of the christian bible should be taken seriously, only understood metaphorically

fundamentalists took the entire bible seriously

"The Fundamentals" were 9 essays that were supposed to combat religious liberalism
- all 9 essays agreed that modernism is the enemy and the word of the bible was the word of God

peak of the conflict is in the Scopes Trial.
- john scopes is tried for violating the butler act

the scopes trial is a national sensation

Jennings takes to the stand as an expert witness on the Bible.
- is humiliated by Darrow and makes himself look incoherent and blundering

fundamentalists win the trial but modernists win public perception

## Rebirth of the KKK

"The Birth of a Nation" is a film that valorizes the reconstruction era Klan
- leads to a huge increase in popularity

The new surge of popularity leads to the organization of the "second" KKK
- this new klan is extremely popular and spreads all over the country with more than 5 million members

the KKK is no longer stuck with just the south and lower class people
- it spreads to the north and across all social classes

The flapper lifestyle was a carefree way of living for women at the time that broke a ton of social norms.
