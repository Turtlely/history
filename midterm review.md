## Westward Expansion overview
1. Land, mining, and railroads bring settlers to the west
2. New machines and technology allow crop farmers to grow more crops
	- however, these are really expensive and prices are now falling
		- too many crops = too much supply, leads to prices falling prohibitively low
		- there isnt enough money in the economy for people to buy enough food to pay back the farmers

Homestead act of 1862 gives out millions of acres of land to people.
- everybody can apply for 160 acres of land
- this is passed to promote westward expansion

people are also drawn to the west for minerals and metals
- however these resources are quickly sucked up and the towns become ghost towns

**biggest** cause for westward expansion are the railroads
- so much land is given to RR companies by the government

# industrial farming
machinery makes farming faster and more efficient
farmers now focus on growing cash crops
1. when crop prices are high, farmers do well. when prices are low, farmers do bad

farmers are in trouble because they overproduced food
- supply exceeds demand
- government promotes deflation, making money more scarce
- railroads charge high prices that make it cheaper for farmers to burn crops than sell them

farmers are driven into bankruptcy

they promote bimetalism because that can cause inflation and allow people to buy more food
