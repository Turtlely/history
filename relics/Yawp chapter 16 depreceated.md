# Great Railroad Strike of 1877
- Railroad economy bubble bursts
- Workers wages are slashed, angering them greatly
- Rail workers all around the country respond by going on strike, destroying railroad property, and protesting
- Strike breakers, state miliita, and US troops are used to break strikes, numerous people are killed every time
- Eventually the US troops succeed in stamping out the strikes, but the damage had been done
	- Laborers around the country now realize the importance of a organized labor union

Strikes hit the railroads because no other market had ever recieved so much government and investor funding and government land.
- Workers began to feel powerless, as jobs became less and less skilled which made them disposable
- It became hard to justify working long, dangerous hours for such low pay and low job security

# Taylorism
After the civil war, the US advanced technologically very very fast.

Technology was used to boost the US economy to new heights, because it could be used to advertise, mass manufacture, and transport goods at incredibly low prices all over the country.

Taylorism is the concept of using scientific principles to guide buisness, factory and logistics management. It caused never before seen extremely high efficiencies, which made mass manufacturing possible.

This was done by:
1. Subdivision of tasks, breaking down a complex task into numerous simple and unskilled tasks that could be done quickly
2. new machines made possible by industrialization
3. interchangable parts
4. Assembly lines

The effects of taylorism were demonstrated by Mccormick's factories that produced the Mccormick plow.
- Mccormick hired a new production manager for a factory
- This resulted in the price of a Mccormick plow drop, as well as more than doubling the production output of Mccormick's factories every year.

This industrialization, mass manufacturing, and increases in efficiency pushed the US economy onto the global stage, as it began catching up to, and exceeding the production of other countries.

# Monopoly
Mass production was only feasible for extremely wealthy individuals who had the capital to create giant factories that produced thousands of goods a day.

This crushed small buisnesses who could no longer compete, and eventually led to the economy being dominated by large companies owned by extremely wealthy individuals.

However, mass manufacturing had extremely slim profit margins, and competition between companies began to cause large losses in profit. 
- Companies do anything they can, to avoid competition
- They combine into conglomerates, they form trusts and pools, they divide markets, fixed prices
This resulted in companies monopolizing the market, and wealthy individuals getting wealthier.

# Inequality
Industrialization brought about unprecedented booms to the US economy, creating numerous economic opportunities for everyone.

However, this begins to lead to the rise of inequality.
- Mass manufacturing demands cheap, unskilled labor
	- This means that workers are subject to poor working conditions, job security, and wages.
	- It is very hard, essentially impossible to advance your career because every job is extremely unskilled and workers are disposable.

This leads to the rich getting richer, and the poor staying in poverty.

Described by mark twain as the "Gilded Age"
- Many Americans were bewildered by how the US economy could be doing so good, while they were living in slums being paid nothing.


# Social Darwinism
Social Darwinism was the result of applying Darwins theory of natural selection to societies.

It essentially states that the fittest will do the best in a society, while the unfit will stay at the bottom of society.

This becomes a popular mode of thought in this time period, especially among the upper class.

Some people say social darwinism is the way of nature
- The claim is that by helping the poor, you take away from the successful people, promoting a mediocre society

Some people say social darwinism will lead to the degeneration of society.
- These people say that social darwinism removes the fundamental right for every american to be able to live a good, financially stable life.

Social Darwinism ends up being a moral justification for the widening class divide and increasing inequality in american society

# Republican party
The republican party rose as an anti-slavery faction, commited to free labor
- Free labor means that every american has the right to decide who and what they want to work for

# Labor movements
Social darwinism was widely unpopular among the working class for obvious reasons.
Workers being going on strikes, protesting

Unions are occasionally formed, but essentially dissolve immediately afterwards

The failure of the Great Railroad Strike of 1877 has made it clear that an organized union would be necessary

## Knights of Labor
The knights of labor were a union group that achieved some popularity
- This was due to its efforts to unite both skilled and unskilled laborers

Their dream was of a hard working producing society that rewarded hard work and labor, instead of capital
- However, the knights ended up focusing more on practical gains instead of their vision

In 1886, a KOL member is fired for attending a union meeting
- The local union responds by walking off the job
This results in thousands of unions going on strike around the country to strike against Jay Gould's rail lines.

They start destroying property in their strikes, and Jay Gould's hires the pinkertons and strike breakers.
- In addition, they got state militia and Texas Rangers to help too

Eventually, the strike is broken, but the KOL regroup and plan another strike.
- They want an 8 hour work day

The demand for the 8 hour work day ends up with 300k-500k workers going on strike around the country.

This is where the Haymarket incident occurs

Immediately after the Haymarket incident, the KOL fall out because they become associated with radicalism and violence.

## American Federation of Labor

This was the successor of the Knights of Labor

The idea of a producer focused society is rejected, the AFL wants a simple trade union.
- They want simple, practical gains such as higher wages, less hours, and safer conditions

They tried to avoid strikes, but workers kept going on strike anyways.


After wage cuts in one of Carnegie's steel mills, workers take over the plant and go on strike.

The plant operator calls in the pinkertons, but the pinkertons end up losing.

Eventually, state milita is called in and the group is dissolved.


# Populists
Farmers were hit hard by industrialization.
Although new technologies were made, and farming became more efficient, their income was now directly tied to the day to day fluctuations in the US economy.

This makes many farmers feel uneasy, because they are now getting paid less and less for crops and are forced to buy expensive machinery.

The Farmers Alliance was the group formed by many farmers who were worried about their future.

Their idea was to share machinery, bargain with wholesalers, and negotiate for higher crop prices.

They had a vision of a cooperative commonwealth that protected the many from the few greedy people

Alliance members form a political party, the Populist party to run.

They advocated for:
1. Extending and improving the nation's railroad systems
2. Establishment of communal warehouses called subtreasuries, where farmers could put their crops inside when the market was poor, and still get paid.

Ultimately, they want to shift power back to the producing class of the US.
