# Yawp Chapter 19

## Introduction

## Patterns of American Interventions
Asian markets were vital to American commerce, despite them being small.
- When these markets are threatened, Americans would intervene.

Open Door Policy:
- Called for all western powers to have equal access to chinese markets.
- Made by John Hay, he was afraid that other imperial powers would cut up china


President McKinley sent the U.S. Army without talking to congress
- This sets a precedent for future U.S. presidents to control the world under their power

U.S. acquires its first pacific islands from the Guano Islands Act of 1856.

Missionaries often worked with buisnesses, as they shared a similar goal

Hawaii became ruled by an oligarchy of sugar companies
- Big Five

U.S. enters late 19th century with aggressive attitude towards the southern countries.
- America invests lots of money into mexico in late 19th and early 20th century
	- Porfirio Diaz was overthrown, leading to the end of the friendly relations with the U.S.
- Huerta executed Madero, a democratically elected president
	- Woodrow Wilson does not recognize the new government unless Huerta steps down. Huerta refuses
		- Wilson gets an opportunity to invade Veracruz to prevent arms from reaching Huerta
		- When Huerta's government falls in 1914, the U.S. occupies the land until november

U.S.'s actions during the mexican revolution show how American policy could be used to justify intervention because it could potentially affect its citizens.

## III) 1898
The Philippine-American wars marked a crucial turning point in American intervention.
- U.S. begins to become very active in international politics, especially Latin America.

Questions are raised:
1. Should the U.S. act as an empire?
	- ==Is it antithetical to its founding democrat ideals?==
	- Some people are opposed to expansion because it goes against the founding ideals
2. Can colonial subjects be safely integrated as Americans?

McKinley becomes worried about the safety of Americans in Cuba during the Cuban revolution.
- sends the *Maine* to Havana Harbor in 1898
	- On febuary 15th it is sunk, killing 3/4ths of the ship's occupants

Yellow Journals are newspapers that notoriously promoted sensational stories at the cost of accuracy
- They immediately capitalize on the sinking of the Maine, calling for war with Spain.
- This war is called "A Splendid Little War" by Secratary of state John Hay

==America feels an empowerment or duty to "liberate" the world from its struggles==
- Albert J. Beridge said that America had a mission to perform

U.S. helped the Philippines fight for independence against the Spanish
- However, right afterwards, the U.S. occupied the islands, fighting against Filipino insurrectionists.
- Reports of war crimes and cruelty on both sides brings public attention to this war


## IV) Theodore Roosevelt and American Imperialism

Roosevelt wanted to annex Hawaii:
1. Deny Japanese expansion and limit west coast threats
2. Excellent port for battleships

==Roosevelt insists that the big stick of the U.S. can ensure its dominance in the western hemisphere.==
- Did not have the ability to use military to impose this on south and central americ
	- Instead, it goes for Dollar Diplomacy to assert dominance
		- Loans are provided to Latin American countries for some level of control
		- This creates instability in the countries
			- These countries are modernized, but they also become destabilized because of rising debts to european and american bankers

Roosevelt Corollary:
- The U.S. will treat any european intervention in latin america as a threat to american security
This policy justifies numerous military actions in Carribean and Latin American countries.
- These countries are portrayed as primitive and dysfunctional
- It is the U.S.'s manly duty to exercise its power to extend anglo saxon civilization to these countries

Roosevelt did not really advocate expansion via military force
- Only used military power to protect national interests and spheres of influence when absolutely necessary


## V) Women and Imperialism
Heinz is looking for a young lady to demonstrate Heinz products
- McLeod was this demosnstrator
	- Functioned to project an image of middle class American life

American Imperialism offered a range of opportunities for white, middle class, christian women.
- They could serve as teachers, medical professionals, and missionaries

Only Europeans and Americans had attained the highest level of civilization
- Marked by an industrial economy and gender division where men and women have diverging but complementary roles
- Social and technological progress freed women of burdens of labor
	- They are now in a position of moral and spiritual authority

## IV) Immigration
Imperialism has a desire for markets for american goods.
- These goods are made primarily by immigrant labor
There is a sense of growing dependent on others as producers and consumers, which created lots of anxiety among native born americans.

Despite the fact that the U.S. economy relied on large amounts of immigrant labor, many americans didnt like the arrival of so many immigrants.

immigrants are stigmitized against because it is thought that:
1. They are unfit for american democracy
2. They used violence and bribery
3. More immigrants would lead to fewer jobs and lower wages
4. they would bring radical ideas

"Immigration may bring some benefits, but it also brings disease, ignorance, crime ..."
- Sanborn

Many feared that immigrants would bring down the racial, economic, and moral integrity of America

The chinese were the first racial group who were legally excluded from immigration
- Racial hostility in california had led to this
- Opponents claimed that chinese immigrants were corrupting american society with cheap labor and immoral practices

Immigration critics pointed at the shifting demographic of immigration
- New immigrants are poor, didnt really speak english, and werent protestant
This calls into question the ability of these immigrants to actually assimialte into american life

Immigrants are viewed as inferior

How assimilated should immigrants become?
