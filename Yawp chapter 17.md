# Introduction

Originally, many european countries and the US cooperated with the native americans, forming trade deals and integrating them into their economies.

However, once the civil war ended, industrialization began which led to the inevitable western expansion that fed the economy during this period.

# Post civil war western migration
People came to the plains for different reasons
1. Some people came for the metal riches, attracted by gold rushes and silver rushes
	1. Ironically, the buisnesses that made money off the prospective miners were the most successful
2. Some people came to hunt the buffalo in the plains
3. Some people moved due to religious reasons
	1. Mormons moved to Salt Lake City, Utah
		1. Escaping religious prosecution because many of the people in the east were suspicious of their faith.
4. Land

Ultimately, land was the biggest drawing factor for many families.

Family farms at the time were the backbone of the agricultural economy after the civil war.

The Homestead act allowed many families to acquire many acres of high quality land for very cheap. This was extremely alluring to many many families, which led to many families migrating west.

# Indian wars and peace policies

The Indian wars were a series of sporadic battles between the US government and native americans living on western land

Industrialization essentially made Jefferson's dream of indians living in isolated areas in the west impossible.

Indian removal was doubly emphasized after the civil war

Tensions erupted between the Dakota and white settlers who were illegally settling into their land.
- The white settlers lived unsustainably and began starving out the Dakota, as hunting and farming became unsustainable

One day, Dakota tribe members kill 5 white settlers, which is then followed by an attack on an Agency building.

They then attacked a US military base, killing more.

The Cheyenne chief, Black Kettle believed that a peace treaty was the best way for his people. He arranged for peace talks in denver, but it turned out to be a slaughter as he was killed.

Many female christian missionaries aimed to replace the tribal social unit with individual households
