# I) Introduction

Swift changes in the U.S. industrial system are causing swift changes in religious, political, and social structures.

The problems of the gilded age are now confronting Americans
- Massive concentration of wealth
- Urban squalor
- Tensions between capital and labor
- loosening social morals
- unsanitary food production
- foreign immigration
- enviromental destruction
- political radicalism

Farmers and laborers had always been fighting against capitalists and political conservatives
- However, at the end of the 19th century, a whole new generation of the American middle-class put themselves into public life and become advocates for reform
	- These middle class individuals were affected by the problems of the gilded age

All of the dissatisfaction with the new trends in American society created the progressive era
- Americans began thinking about how their country should develop and where protection should be allocated
- Reformers wanted to clean up politics
- Black americans wanted civil rights
- women wanted suffrage and a larger role in society
- workers want higher wages, safer workplaces, and unionization

# II) Mobilizing for Reform

The Triangle Shirtwaist Facotry caught fire in 1911.
- The doors of the factory were chained shut to keep employees inside and a poorly made fire ladder on the side of the building collapsed
- 71 workers were injured and 146 died, massive american tragedy

The girls who died in the factory went on strike a year prior, and demanded a safer workplace. This was not granted to them, leading to their deaths.

The owners of the factory were brought to manslaughter charges, but were acquitted
- This continues a trend of buisness owners not being held accountable for worker deaths

The triangle shirtwaist factory made Americans realize that their country needed reform.
- These reformers turned to various ways to publicize the problems they wanted to fix
	- Journalists who exposed buisness practices, poverty, and corruption were called muckrakers
		- McClure's was a magazine that detailed political corruption
		- These muckrakers confirmed that there was significant political corruption
			- For a long time, everyone suspected these things, but there was no real evidence so their claims were not taken seriously
	- Jacob Riis published "How the Other Half Lives"
		- This was a book that documented urban poverty in vivid detail.
		- The book led to housing reform in NYC and other cities
	- Sinclair published "The Jungle"
		- A novel intended to reveal labor exploitation in the meatpacking industry, but actually ended up causing change and reform in the sanitation practices of the meatpacking industry
			- For a long time, slaughterhouses were pretty much invisible to the consumer, who had no idea about how their food was actually prepared
		- Led to the passing of the Meat Inspection Act and Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906
	- Edward Bellamy published "Looking Backward"
		- This was a very popular novel about a man who falls asleep in 1887 and wakes up in 2000.
		- His vision of a reformed society inspired readers and pushed them to reform.

"What Would Jesus Do"
- his was a novel about a pastor who was confronted by an unemployed migrant who criticised his lack of concern for the poor
	- Was a best seller, and connected with the social gospel
- A question many americans asked themselve

The social gospel was a movement that emphasized the need for Christians to save society as well as individual souls.
- Christians felt the moral duty to engage society, challege political social and economic systems, and create reform to make a society that jesus would be proud of
- However it wasnt all good
	- Men often ignored issues that women faced and did not support womens suffrage
	- Native americans and other oppressed minorities were ignored

# III) Women's Movements

Reform created new opportunities for women to begin advocating for change
- Womens clubs and social organizations are formed, and they begin looking at what the place of women should be in society and politics

Examples of womens clubs:
- General Federation of Women's Clubs
	- Advocated for suffrage and womens rights
- National Association of Colored Women
	- Advocated for suffrage and womens rights

These womens clubs are not very tolerant of african americans still, even if they were fighting for the same purpose

Black women in america formed social organizations to advocate for racial and gender equality
- These were very influential and fought against suffrage, amplifying the efforts of Black women in challenging discrimination

Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was a organization founded for temperance
- However, Frances Willard changed it up by adopting any and all reform that would improve social welfare and advance women's rights
- They worked to fix urban poverty, add child labor laws, prison reform, and the 8 hour work day

Jane Addams founded Hull House, a settlement house that was meant to provide for the community by running classes, events, and a nursery.
- However, Florence Kelley convinced Addams to begin work in social reform.
- Hull House became a scientific social reform powerhouse
	- Exposed conditions in sweatshops
	- Advocated for worker organization
	- Surveyed the community and produced statistics and papers documenting poverty, disease, and living conditions

Womens Suffrage was typically mixed with other reform activities
- Some argued that women's votes were needed to claen politics and combat social evils
- Some saw suffrage as a way to further economic interests of women
	- The worker must have bread, but she must also have roses
- Some argued that white women were needed to maintain white supremacy
	- Empowering middle and upper class white women could counteract black voters
The point is that women's suffrage was composed of numerous groups that did not have to necessarily agree with one another, they all worked towards the same goal and did accomplish it.

Alice Paul was the leader of the womens suffrage movement run by the National Woman's Party
- Picketed the White House

# IV) Targeting the Trusts

People believe that corrupt politicians and corporations have way too much power and money. They think that the power should come back to the citizens and be taken from the powerful

Specifically, people believed that wealth inequality was the cause of the loss of power from people.

A trust is a monopoly or cartel that entered into agreements to exercise exclusive control over a certain product or industry.

Following the second industrial revolution, the federal government adopted a "Laisez faire" economic policy (Hands off economic policy)
- This unregulated buisness enviroment allowed major trusts to develop

Carnegie used vertical integration
- Controlled every phase of buisness, from raw materials to distribution
Rockerfeller used horizontal integration
- Bought out competing refineries 

The moment these companies were dominant, they could do whatever they wanted

The great merger movement was the consolidation of nearly 4000 companies into 257 corporate firms

Big buisnesses were difficult to manage under american law.
- They often operated in multiple states, nationwide

Farmers pushed for Granger Laws
- Laws that regulated railroads
- Railroads oppose this because they restrain profits and made it difficult to meet standards of regulation in each state

Interstate Commerce Act was passed to stop discriminatory and predatory pricing practices
Sherman Anti-Trust Act was designed to limit anticompetitive practices like trusts.
- Declared that not all trusts were illegal, only those that stifled free trade
- However, the law was written vaguely and ended up being used to limit the power of labor unions
- Clayton Anti-Trust act made the sherman act more powerful

Roosevelt was not antibuisness, but did push for antitrust legislation and regulations
- He believed there were good and bad trusts
- First major politician to go after trusts
- He was interested in regulating companies not dissolving corporations

Howard Taft wanted to dissolve corporations
- doubled the number of monopoly breakups that roosevelt did
- Went after U.S. Steel

# V) Progressive Enviromentalism

The industrial revolution really messed up the enviroment

Preservation: 
- Seeks to protect nature from use
- was an escape from increasingly urban life
Conservation:
- Seeks to use nature properly
- Was closely aligned with broader trends in American society
	- Nature has lots of resources

conservationism usually just benefits financial interests
- Many states passed laws to regulate hunting and protect wildlife
	- These disproportionately affected italians, because they hunted for subsistence and did not make enough money to buy permits or pay fines


Jane Addams and Florence kelley focused on health and sanitation
There was lots of effort put into reforming public health, waste management, and urban enviroments

Country Life movement was designed to take students outside to experience nature


# VI) Jim Crow and African American Life


White southerners want to purify the ballot box
- Wanted to prevent racial sttrife by legislating segregation

Series of legal hurdles were made to make voting very difficult for African Americans
- Poll tax
- removal of suffrage from people who commited petty crimes
- literacy test
- understanding clause
- grandfather clause

Maintaining white supremacy in the rural areas did not require segregation
- Crop lien and convict lease systems

White supremacy in the city was maintained by segregation because the urban enviroment created a black middle class life that threatened racial heiarchies
- Segregation was created to maintain white supremacy in the city

14th amendement prevented discrimination directly by states, did not prevent it from being done by people or buisnesses
- Southern states exploited this by segregating facilities

Plessy v Fergusson ruling established the legal principle of separate but equal

Segregation and disenfranchisement created structures of racism that basically undid the effort of reconstruction
