# Life in industrial America

# I. Introduction

Chicago is described by Rudyard Kipling to be "captivated by technology" and "blinded by greed". With no colorr in the streets and no beauty.

**Chicago embodies the triumph of American Industrialization**.
- Its meatpacking industry was the prime example of changes in American life.
	- The era of big buisness brought large corporations and run by managers (new management styles have been introduced thanks to taylorism).
	- Meat processing industry produced 4/5ths of the US consumed meat.
	- The meatpacking industry was closely tied to urban immigration
		- Immigrants effectively make up an extremely large portion of the US workforce.
			- Nearly 80% of the chicago population in 1900
- The explosive growth mirrors national trends
	- In 1870, a quarter of the nation lived in large towns or cities.
		- These city dwellers are both citizens from rural america, but also immigrants from overseas.
			- Germany, British Isles, Scandanavia Poles, Italians, Czechs, Hungarians, Lithuanians.

The rise of the american city life, american immigration and labor, leads to:
1. Concentrated wealth
	1. The middle class forming
	2. Large gap between elite and poor, leads to strikes
2. Growth of vast city slums
	1. People are immigrating into cities to look for work, leading to development
3. Destruction of family farming
	1. Mass production and the great merging have crippled small buisness and specially family farmers

# II. Industrialization and tech innovation
Railroads were the first thing to cause concentration of capital.
- The government gave millions of dollars and acres of land to wealthy buisness owners to fund railroad construction.
	- The extremely high cost of the railroad buisness effectively prevents people from entering the buisness, leading to the railroad monopoly

The new scale at which buisnesses operated, the national scale, meant that a change in buisness structure was needed. 
- Managers are hired

Laborers originally saw factory work as a stepping stone to owning their own buisness.
- After the war, the industrial revolution brought new techniques such as the assembly line, mass production, and taylorism, as well as mechanization of jobs which was done by tools such as the McCormick reaper.
- This meant that not many workers could actually achieve economic independence, they just cant afford to stay in the economy on their own.

Industrialization led to the linking of urban consumers and rural producers, forming the single national market.
- Food production and consumption are now nationalized, and chicago is the knot that ties it together.
	- Cattle are driven from texas to chicago by train, where they are slaughtered and packed, before being delivered all over the country by rail.

This insane level of mechanization and innovation left americans in awe.
- the New York Daily Graphic published an april fools prank interview with Thomas Edison, where he said he made a miracle machine that could make any food from air.
	- Some people actually believed this, as they had seen the incredible amounts of innovation and scientific advancement.

Edison wanted to make electrical power and lighting a thing for cities.
- He succeeds and constructs 330 plants powering >60k lamps all over the city.
- humanity has beat the night
	- factories now work at every hour of the day

# III. Immigration and Urbanization

Industry pulled ever more Americans into cities. 
- Manufacturing needed the labor

Many people immigrated to the US because:
1. They heard about the opportunities in the US factories and wanted to save up to send money home

Usually, immigrants intended to return home when they had enough money to buy land.
The ones that stayed assimilated in the American melting pot.

Immigrants wrote home and encouraged others to follow
- Chain migration

City politics adapted to immigrant populations
- These politics act as a kind of charity

Tammany Hall was the NYC's democratic party machine.
- It drew the most trouble from critics
	- William Tweed basically stole millions of dollars from the taxpayers
		- Bought chairs for 60$ using taxpayer money, made the seller return 50$ to Tweed and keep 10$ for the chair
- Responded most to immigrant needs.

Tammany Hall's corruption under the reign of Boss Tweed was notorious
- The projects that Tammany Hall created provided essential infrastructure and public services for the growing population.
- Despite this, the quality of life in the cities dropped, as immigrants found themselves in crime ridden slums that couldnt keep up with the urban growth.

Some americans romanticize the rural life
- Rural life has a reputation of being undeveloped and has bad social position
- "Agriculture does not hold the same relative rank among our industries that it did in former years"
- "Every agricultural question is a city question"

Suburbs develop out of the desire for a middle ground between city and rural life

# IV. The new south and race

After the civil war and reconstruction, many white southern buisness and political leaders wanted a new south that embraced agriculture and turned their back to the past.
- They want infrastructure and industry
- The new south should be like the north
- Notable people include Henry Grady

However, the new south is pretty much the same as the old south.

Emancipation unsettled the southern order.
- Right after reconstruction, anxious whites fight abck and immediately use their political power to repress the newly freed slaves.
	- Jim Crow laws
	- Segregation
	- "Separated but equal"
	- Lynchings


White mobs kill roughly 5k African Americans between 1880 and 1950.

Lynching is not just murder, its basically a festival.
- Victims were killed in front of massive crowds from all over the country.
- Lynchings are treated like carnival attractions.
- Sam Hose is an example of a brutal lynching
	- Pieces were sliced off his body and he screamed in agony.
	- Burnt alive, immolated

Lynching is supported because people argue that it is a necessary evil to punish Blacks.

"Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases" is a groundbreaking documentary that documented southern lynching culture and exposed the myth of the black rapist.
- Made by Ida B Wells, an African American woman who was born near the end of slavery
	- Pioneering anti-lynching advocate

Other than lynching, there were more forms of racial violence against blacks that survived reconstruction.

Populist insurgency created new opportunities for black political activism
- White democrats respond with fear, they form "Red Shirt" groups that are dedicated to eradicating black political participation through violence
- Red Shirts formed armed barricades to prevent black voters from entering town to vote

Lynching and organized terror were only the most violent of southern racism.
- Discrimination in everyday life reflected the rise of the jim crow south.

Jim Crow laws legalized racism effectively.
- Seperate coach cars, drinking fountains, resturants, bathrooms
- Basically all of life was segregated to keep blacks from mixing with whites.

De facto limitations of black voting suppressed black voters
- Whites stuffed ballot boxes, intimidated black voters

De jure limitations of black voting legally prevented black voters from voting.
- Poll taxes, literacy tests


The old south is romanticised, a new civic religion called "The Lost Cause" is formed
- White southerners look forward among contented and loyal slaves.
- Secession had to do with honor and home, not slavery
- People worship the old south, a confederate south.
- "Birth of a nation" almost singlehandedly revives the KKK


It is difficult to bring about the "new south".
- the south lacked much of the infrastructure needed such as railroads.
- the region had a rise in manufacturing textiles, furniture, and steel.
- Industry offered jobs to rural poor who couldnt live off substinence farming
	- These jobs are also segregnd immigration fueled anxieties that old social mores were being subverted and that old forms of social and moral policing were increasingly inadequate. The anonymity of urban spaces presented an opportunity in particular for female sexuality and for male and female sexualated


In summary, the new south existed if you measure the industrial output, but it remained the same or worse in terms of racial inequality.

# V. Gender Religion Culture

The gilded age brought about the combination of higher education and religion.
- Gilded age elite fund fortunes into new elite private institutions
- 1890 Act provides for black colleges in states with segregated universities.

Women begin occupying a larger portion of college students, though this includes womens only colleges.

The increased urbanization, immigration, advancements in science and tech, consumerism, and new awareness of inequalities challenged traditional values and norms.
- People begin to challenge traditional gender norms 
- Everyone wants equal rights

New fashion, entertainment, anonymity all present opportunities for new generations to challenge what they were told to be the "proper" and "right" norms. 

Women work to liberate themselves
- Temperance movement is an example of these moral reforms spearheaded by women/

Many women expressed discontent through literature
- "The Yellow Wallpaper" attacks the "naturalness"
   of female domesticatism
- "The Awakening" criticized the female gender role in society

Men were worried about female activisxm, but they were also worried about their own masculinity
- Many men now worked office jobs sitting in chairs all day, not working in fields
- "Neurasthenia", a new emasculated condition marked by depression, indigestion, hypochondria, and nervousness.

Muscular Christianity sought to make young men back into the manly people they used to be.
- Facilitated primitive encounters with nature
- Boy scouts
- YMCA

Muscular christianity is about building manly bodies, but was also even moreso about building a sense of nationalism and group identity.
- Championed western imperialism
- Cheered on attempts to civilize non-western people
- Men are encouraged to embrace the vision of masculinity connected with nationalism, militarism, and imperialism.

New forms of entertainment arise
- Phonograph and motion pictures

The phonograph was able to play music, and sparked interest in pop music.
The motion picture is used to play short films.

This rise of new forms of entertainment was extremely interesting to americans at the time, people would pay to see simple things because they were new.
- Some people were afraid while others were excited
